# README Generator

## Description

The motivation behind this project was to solidify my knowledge of node. I was to build a README.md generator using the starter code and my knowledge of Javascript and Node. Additionaly, this challenge introduced me to concepts regarding README.md badges and node modules. Using the fs and inquirer modules was also crucial for completing this project. 

A sample README.md generated by the README.md generator is present in the assests folder.
