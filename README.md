## Description

This project is a README generator that allows a user to use the command line interface to generate their very own README file.The motivation behind this project was to solidify my knowledge of Node.js, NPM, and TypeScript. This challenge introduced me to concepts regarding README badges, node modules, and typescript interfaces. Using the fs and inquirer modules was also crucial for completing this project. 

A sample README generated by the README generator is present in the assests folder.

Throughout the development of this project, I gained valuable insights into the following areas:
  
- **TypeScript and Type-Safe Coding**: Using TypeScript has increased my understanding of statically typed languages in the JavaScript ecosystem. I have become familiar with type annotations, interfaces, type inference, function type annotations, and tsconfig.json to ensure type-safety throughout my applications. By making use of TypeScript's compiler and advanced type-checking features, I've been able to catch potential bugs early and streamline the refactoring process. This approach to coding has made my applications more maintainable and helped cultivate the habit of writing self-documenting and predictable code.
  
- **Node.js and Server-Side JavaScript**: Using Node.js has allowed me to create a server-side run environment for JavaScript. Thus, Node.js allows me to use JavaScript not just for front-end but also for back-end development. Also, I have gained a deeper understanding of the non-blocking I/O model that Node.js employs. This knowledge is useful for creating web applications that can handle several operations at the same time.
  
- **Node Package Manager (NPM) and Dependency Management**: I expanded my knowledge of NPM's intricacies and my proficiency in managing project dependencies. This ensures that my project is built on a solid foundation and remains up-to-date with the latest features and security patches.
